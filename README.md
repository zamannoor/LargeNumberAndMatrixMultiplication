# Large Number and Matrix Multiplication

The aim of this project is to implement and evaluate various integer multiplication and matrix multiplication algorithms. The  algorithms that are implemented are grade school algorithm, Gauss algorithm and Karatsuba algorithm for integer multiplication and traditional and Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication. Finally, The performances of each combination of integer multiplication algorithms on matrix multiplication algorithms are measured by varying input size.
